[Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2004.html#toc31) (actual vs. biased)

We read in the necessary dataframes and the variable/column NUMKDHH first.  We make a Pmf object from the thinkstats2 package and then write brief BiasPmf function too, that will take the actual pmf and calculate the perceived (through "perceived" multiplication then normalization), biased Pmf object.

We can then calculate the mean of each object to compare and then also plot them using the thinkplot package.
