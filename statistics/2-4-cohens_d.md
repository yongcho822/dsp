[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

This exercise was fairly straight-forward; we just had to read in the requisite dataframes, and make a function that would mathematically calculate Cohen's D. My interpretation of our result is in the code - I print it.
