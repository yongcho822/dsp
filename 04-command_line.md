# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours.

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of commands and what they do, focused on things that are new, interesting, or otherwise worth remembering.

I made a written cheatsheet on a notepad.

What does `ls` do? What do `ls -a`, `ls -l`, and `ls -lh` do? What combinations of those flags are meaningful?

`ls` lists out the contents of the folder/directory you're currently in. 
`ls -a` lists all the files that start with '.', including the hidden ones.
`ls -l` lists all the files in a long listing format.
`ls -lh` is the same as `ls -l` but lists the filesize in a human readable format. (h stands for human readable).
Flag combinations can all be useful in their unique ways. For instance, ls -al would list EVERYTHING if you wanted to just see all the information of all the files in your folder.
